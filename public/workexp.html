        <h2><a id="socks-u-wear">2015-2023: Socks-U-Wear Ltd. <em>(8 years)</em></a></h2>
        <p>
            As the IT manager of an e-commerce company, I was responsible for the management of IT systems,
            facilities, and projects. I was also solely responsible for developing and supporting bespoke
            software for the company.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am very proud of my achievements with the software and systems that I developed and managed
            while working at Socks-U-Wear Ltd. I significantly improved the daily workflow efficiency allowing 
            the company to grow to over Â£3 million annual turnover in 2022 with a high profit margin. I was 
            described by the director of the company as one of the most valuable assets to the business.
        </p>

        <h3>Notable Projects at Socks-U-Wear Ltd.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>Order collection and despatch applications</h4>
                <p>
                    Two bespoke desktop (.NET WinForms) applications I developed with C# to be used during daily
                    operations. Both applications were different from each other to account for their use by two
                    different departments but would achieve similar goals. At their core, both applications would
                    select the best shipping carrier for an order based on various factors. Using various APIs it
                    would create shipments, update the order's status with/without a tracking number and print any
                    returned shipping labels.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Various C# class libraries</h4>
                <p>
                    I created various class libraries to use with other applications I 
                    developed. A couple notable examples include a class library containing methods to handle 
                    reading/writing delimited files/strings, and API client libraries to handle connecting and 
                    consuming web APIssuch as Amazon (AWS, MWS and SP-API), Royal Mail and Channeladvisor.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Microsoft Excel Macros (using VBA Code)</h4>
                <p>
                    I created a range of advanced macros and forms using VBA code. 
                    These macros added a good degree of automation to enhance the speed and accuracy of 
                    certain daily tasks and data entry involving spreadsheets.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Site Networking</h4>
                <p>
                    With very limited previous experience, I set-up the networking for the business, 
                    using specialist tools to install wall sockets and Ethernet cabling to a professional standard. 
                    The network connected multiple rooms around the site and a range of devices including 
                    desktop computers, laptops, printers, landlines, and cameras.
