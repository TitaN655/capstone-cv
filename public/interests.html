        <h2>Interests &amp; Hobbies</h2>
        <p>
            Outside of learning and improving my software development skills with various personal projects, I 
            enjoy photography and miniature painting. I also enjoy computer games with moderation. Beyond 
            that I have enjoyed modifying a few computer games and in some cases I have created multiplayer 
            levels/maps. These interests even drove me to create my own online community.

                <h4>ETernal Clan online gaming community</h4>
                <p>
                    In 2011 I set-up and, for years, maintained an online 
                    community where I gathered and worked with a team of people from very different backgrounds. I 
                    worked on installing, setting up, developing, and moderating a web forum built on PhpBB and 
                    multiple game servers hosted with an Ubuntu and later a Debian server. From this I learnt many 
                    useful ICT, software development, teamwork, and communication skills as well as experience of 
                    completing tasks under pressure and to promised deadlines

                <h4>Online forum software</h4>
                <p>
                    My current personal project is creating an online forum
                    software to help grow my knowledge with certain .NET and web technologies including 
                    ASP.NET MVC, Bootstrap, JavaScript/TypeScript, and SQL Server.
