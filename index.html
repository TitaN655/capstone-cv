        <h2>Personal Summary</h2>
        <p>
            I am an IT professional and a passionate software developer with an analytical and creative 
            approach to problem solving. I currently specialise with .NET and C# but with my excellent 
            understanding of foundational programming concepts I am driven to quickly learn, adapt, and 
            improve my skills in other areas as well. Alongside my technical ability, I have various desirable 
            professional skills and experience including managing and working with teams of people in various 
            collaborative projects both in- and outside of a professional environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            With a deep love for computers, I am fascinated by the boundless potential of technology. My 
            technical skills are built upon this passion, and I am driven to further explore the potentials of
            software development. Having worked on a range of professional and personal projects, I have 
            gained experience in:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Using object-oriented programming languages (such as C#, PHP and Visual Basic).</li>
            <li>Developing and supporting .NET Windows applications in a professional environment.</li>
            <li>Implementing web APIs from various providers (both REST and SOAP).</li>
            <li>Developing and supporting websites, web applications and databases including using various web languages (such as HTML, CSS, SQL, and PHP).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            With my professional and technical skills, passion, and willingness to learn more in this area, I 
            believe that I can be a valuable asset to any team.
        </p>
